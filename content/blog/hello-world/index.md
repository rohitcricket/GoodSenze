This is our first post on our blog! How exciting!

We want to talk about how we came up with the name of our site: GoodSenze. We believe that
folks have lost what is known as 'common sense' or in the folksy version, good sense. 
What is common sense? A dictionary defintion says it is good sense and sound judgment in practical matters.
Good sense is just understanding reality and behaving accordingly. 

Covid-19 is a wakeup call for entrepreneurs and folks in general. Expert advice givers recognize that 
and you see an explosion of services promising instant success via ...

But does that all make sense? What about challenging the status-quo? The standard advice? What about 
questioning how one should move forward in the post covid-19 world? 

Our approach is different. We don't promise instant results and don't charge $$$. Our approach is:
1. Identify the real problems? What is getting in your way of success?
2. The three cirles: you, others and the market.
3. Pay-as-you go model. We start with blogs, ebooks, and pay-as-you go consulting. 
4. We believe in 'traction' and 'momentum'. Folks focus on the 'start' and then the celebratory or failed end. Starts are really important, but what about, as Scott Belsky noted, what about the 'messy middle'? 

Gaining traction and momentum is the way to deal with the messy middle.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
